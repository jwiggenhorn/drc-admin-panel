        No personal identifiable information is collected from users of the DRC
        Interface mobile application. The only data that is collected is the
        state of various controls at relative timestamps. If the user interacts
        with a control such as a joystick, button, or slider on screen within
        the DRC Interface application, the state of that control will be
        recorded along with the timestamp at which the interaction occurred
        relative to when the user pressed the START button. After the user
        completes their participation in the study by pressing the STOP button
        and confirming their submission, this input data is anonymously and
        securely sent directly to our backend. This input data can then only be
        viewed by the creator and administrator of that particular study.
